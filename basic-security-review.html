<p>Sometimes people ask me what they need to do to make their site "secure".</p>
<p>While there is a wide world of nearly endless possibilities you can consider, the reality is that with making a handful of simple 
good choices, and signing up for a little discipline in development, you can be much more confident that you've at least got the 
main bases covered, and that someone trying to harm your users has to at least work hard for it.</p>
<p>I wrote this document to cover the main points I consider when building or reviewing a site. Of course, this is not an exhaustive
list, but it's a good place to start!</p>
