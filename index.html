<p>Hi! My name is James, and my passion is solving real-world problems with simple, useful, secure technology solutions.</p>
<p>There is something immensely satisfying to me in knowing that something I built, or helped build, is being used and enjoyed
by real people, doing real work, every day.</p>

  <h3>People</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>You're the expert, I'm here to help</strong><br />
    You know what problems you face, tools you use, and goals you're working toward. My job is to listen carefully and help build 
    a system that fits your unique needs simply and securely and is a joy to work in!

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>A solution is no good if it harms people.</strong><br />
    No system is 100% secure, but it is my professional responsibility to get as close as possible while still meeting your 
    specific needs. Sometimes it means making tough choices, but it is a responsibility very seriously.

  <h3>Longevity</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Be creative, but do it responsibly.</strong><br />
    Technology evolves quickly these days. It is important to temper new, creative ideas with responsible, long-term thinking 
    to ensure systems are built on a solid, mature foundation that will last and grow with it's users.
  </p>

<p>
  I do my best to strike a balance between these core concerns to ensure that what comes out is a safe, simple, easy-to-use 
  system that will remain useful, relevant, and extendable for years to come.
