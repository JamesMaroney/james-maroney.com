<p>Hi! My name is James, and my passion is solving real-world problems with simple, useful, secure technology solutions.</p>
<p>There is something immensely satisfying to me in knowing that something I built, or helped buid, is being used and enjoyed
by real people, doing real work, every day.</p>

<h2>My Philosopy</h2>
<div class='points'>
<div class='people'>
  <h3>People</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>You're the expert, I'm here to help</strong><br />
    I believe that my clients are the experts in their fields. They know the problems they face, the tools they use, and the
    goals they are trying to achieve. I always work with my clients to understand these factors, listen carefully to their
    needs, wants, and desires - and then work closely with them to design and build a system that works as perfectly for them as
    possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    I care greatly that users enjoy working in systems I design and build. There are so many outdated, painful solutions out
    there - that this is my tiny way of using my talents to help make the world a better place.
  </p>

<div class='security'>
  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>A solution is no good if it harms people.</strong><br />
    It is my responsibility to design and build as secure as possible. While no system is 100% secure, there are
    many choices that can make or break the security of a system. As a professional developer, these choices are
    my responsibility, and I take that very seriously. I don't want any system I build to end up on the news for leaking data, 
    and I don't ever want users who entrust their data to a system I've built to be harmed by me not doing the best I can 
    to secure their data.
  </p>

  <h3>Longevity</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Be creative, but do it responsibly.</strong><br />
    This day and age, we have at our fingertips an entire world of amazing technology and tools that have evolved very quickly
    over the past few decades - and continues to mature every day. We have tools available to us today that we barely could've
    dreamed of years ago. This means two things to me, personally, that must always be kept in balance:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>We cannot limit our solutions to the problems of today with tools of the past.</li>
    <li>We cannot let ourselves chase an ever-changing ecosystem of tools for the sake of "staying current".</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    I do my best to strike a good balance between these two competing forces to use proven technologies that will be around
    and I think will remain relevant and up to date for a long time, and that also give us access to new tools and techniques to
    ensure that my clients are getting the best solutions possible that will continue to be usabe, secure, and viable for years to
    come.
